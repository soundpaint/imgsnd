	ImageSound release 1.0-alpha1

These are the release notes for the ImageSound utility, release
1.0-alpha1. Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all
about, explain how to install the system, and what to do if something
goes wrong. 

WHAT IS ImageSound?

  ImageSound is a Java(tm)-based utility for converting images into
  sound. ImageSound supposes that the image is a graphical
  representation of the sound spectrum over the time.
  Thus, it converts a discrete series of disctrete spectra into a
  discrete series of samples. ImageSound stores these samples in a
  special system independent file format. You can convert the output
  of ImageSound into a proprietary format using one of the sound
  file format converting utilities.
  Currently, the following converters are available:

    SAM2AU (ImageSound Sample File Format to Sun Audio File Format)

  ImageSound is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details. 

ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

  ImageSound is fully written in Java; so, virtually, it runs on any
  platform that a java runtime environment (JRE) is available for.
  ImageSound requires JRE/JDK1.1.x or higher.

DOCUMENTATION:

  The directory doc contains a collection of various documentation in
  specific subdirectories.

  - The directory doc/api contains the API documentation in html
    format as generated from the javadoc utility.

INSTALLING:

  Create a directory as home for the ImageSound system, e.g.:

	mkdir C:\ImageSound			% Windows95/NT(tm)

	mkdir $HOME/ImageSound			% Unix(tm)

  Copy the compressed file ImageSound.tgz or ImageSound.zip into this
  directory. Go into the directory with the command `cd'. Uncompress
  the file with

	unzip SysExEdit.zip

  or

	gunzip -c SysExEdit.tgz | tar -xf -

COMPILING:

  With the shell command `cd', go into the directory that contains
  this README file.

  On Unix systems, type `make all'.

  On Windows95/NT systems, type `make.bat'.

  file, if present. If that does not help, email me:
